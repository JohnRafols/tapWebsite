Back-end stuff I did.

1.) Added fields to Freelancer Profiles:
- About Me
- Skills 
- Qualifications
- Years in Industry
- Interests

2.)Changed the profilePage-layout.tpl.php. Moved the first sidebar above context

3.) Added new View called Profile Header
- Contextually filtered everything much like the sidebar
- Removed all fields labels

4.) Removed field labels in second sidebar

5.) Applied SASS to remove all block__title, and other misc sass code. 

6.) Changed the fields in the view "My Projects" to display thumbnails.

7.) Projects in the project view are now arranged as a HTML list with the class name .profilePage-projectsRow. Elements are named .profilePage-projectsElement
